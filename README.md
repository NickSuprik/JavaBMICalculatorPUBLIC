# BMI Calculator

## Overview
This Java-based Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator determines a person's BMI based on their weight (in pounds) and height (in inches). It follows the standard American BMI formula and categorizes the result into different health classifications.

## Formula Used
The BMI is calculated using the formula:



\[
BMI = \frac{Weight (lbs)}{Height (inches)^2} \times 703
\]



Where:
- **Weight (lbs)** = User-provided body weight in pounds.
- **Height (inches)** = User-provided height in inches.

## Features
- Accepts user input for weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).
- Performs input validation to ensure correct numerical data is entered.
- Computes BMI and categorizes it into:
  - Underweight (< 18.5)
  - Healthy Weight (18.5 - 24.9)
  - Overweight (25.0 - 29.9)
  - Obesity (30.0 and above)
- Displays the calculated BMI along with the respective category.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.).
3. Compile and run `BMICalculator.java`.
4. Enter the required weight and height when prompted.
5. The program will display the calculated BMI and its classification.

## Example Run
Enter your body weight in pounds (lbs), just the number 160 Enter your height in inches, just the number 68 Your BMI is 24.34 BMI Category: Healthy Weight
